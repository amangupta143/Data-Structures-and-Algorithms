```

Each LeetCode solution includes:
- Detailed problem description
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Solution approach explanation
- Fully commented C++ implementation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amangupta143/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to any solution directory:
   ```bash
   cd Leetcode-Solutions/Question-Name
   ```

3. Read the problem's README.md to understand the approach

4. Compile and run the solution:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -o solution question-name.cpp
   ./solution
   ```

## 💡 LeetCode Solutions

Each solution in the repository follows a consistent structure to help you understand the problem-solving process:

- Problem statement and constraints
- Multiple approaches (when applicable)
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Edge cases and test scenarios
- Detailed code comments explaining the implementation

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later
- Basic understanding of data structures and algorithms
- Git for version control
- CMake (optional, for building complex examples)

## 📝 Compilation Guide

For most solutions, a simple compilation command will suffice:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -o solution question-name.cpp
```

For debugging, you can use:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -g -Wall -Wextra -o solution question-name.cpp
```
