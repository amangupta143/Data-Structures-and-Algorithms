## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find implementations of common data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.). Each chapter/topic has its own directory, making it easy to navigate and explore.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amangupra143/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
2. Navigate to the relevant chapter/topic directory:
   ```bash
   cd Chapters/Chapter01
3. Compile the C++ program:
   ```bash
   g++ -o program_name program_name.cpp
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name


## Chapters

Explore the different chapters in this repository:

- Chapter01: Introduction to arrays
- Chapter02: Linked lists
- Chapter03: Stacks and queues
- ...

Feel free to contribute by adding new chapters or improving existing code!

## Prerequisites

Before running the programs, ensure you have the following installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Any additional libraries or tools specific to certain algorithms (mentioned in respective chapters)

## Compilation and Execution

Compile the C++ programs using the provided instructions in each chapter. Execute the compiled binaries to see the results.

## Contributing
